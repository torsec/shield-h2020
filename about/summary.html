		Nowadays, cybercrime is one of the most relevant and critical threats to both
		the economy and society in Europe. Establishing efficient and effective ways
		to protect services and infrastructures from ever-evolving cyber threats is
		crucial for sustaining business integrity and reputation as well as protecting
		personal and sensitive data.
		</p>
		<p class="text-justify">
		To that end, the <strong>SHIELD</strong> project proposes a universal solution for dynamically
		establishing and deploying virtual security infrastructures into ISP and
		corporate networks. <strong>SHIELD</strong> builds on the huge momentum of
		<em>Network Functions Virtualisation</em> (NFV), as currently standardised by
		ETSI, in order to virtualise security appliances into
		<em>virtual Network Security Functions</em> (vNSFs), to be instantiated within
		the network infrastructure using NFV technologies and concepts, effectively
		monitoring and filtering network traffic in a distributed manner.
		</p>
		<p class="text-justify">
		Logs and metrics from vNSFs are aggregated into an information-driven
		<em>Data Analysis and Remediation Engine</em> (DARE), which leverages
		state-of-the-art big data storage and analytics in order to predict specific
		vulnerabilities and attacks by analysing the network and understanding the
		adversary possibilities, behaviour and intent.
		</p>
		<p class="text-justify">
		The <strong>SHIELD</strong> virtual security infrastructure can either used by the ISP
		internally for network monitoring and protection, but it can also be offered
		as-a-service to ISP customers; for this purpose, <strong>SHIELD</strong>  establishes a
		“vNSF Store”, i.e. a repository of available virtual security functions
		(firewalls, DPIs, content filters etc.) from which the ISP customers can
		select the ones which best match their needs and deploy them to protect their
		infrastructure. This approach promotes openness and interoperability of
		security functions and offers an affordable, zero-CAPEX security solution for
		citizens and SMEs. Moreover, <strong>SHIELD</strong> services can be
		easily scaled up or down, configured and upgraded according to customers’ needs, as opposed to security
		solutions based on monolithic hardware.
